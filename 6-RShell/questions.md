1. How does the remote client determine when a command's output is fully received from the server, and what techniques can be used to handle partial reads or ensure complete message transmission?

The remote client determines when a command's output is fully received from the server by relying on the EOF marker. To handle partial reads or ensure complete transmission the client uses techniques like buffering, looping for complete reads, timeout mechanisms, and error handling.

2. This week's lecture on TCP explains that it is a reliable stream protocol rather than a message-oriented one. Since TCP does not preserve message boundaries, how should a networked shell protocol define and detect the beginning and end of a command sent over a TCP connection? What challenges arise if this is not handled correctly?

Since TCP is a reliable stream protocol and does not preserve message boundaries a networked shell protocol must explicitly define and detect the beginning and end of commands sent over a TCP connection using techniques like delimiters, fixed length headers, or custom framing. This is crucial to ensure that commands are correctly interpreted and executed by the server. If this is not handled correctly challenges such as fragmentation, incomplete commands, merged commands, deadlocks, and security vulnerabilities can arise.

3. Describe the general differences between stateful and stateless protocols.

Stateful protocols maintain context between requests, enabling efficient and personalized interactions but at the cost of scalability and complexity. Stateless protocols treat each request as independent, simplifying implementation and improving scalability but requiring redundant data transmission.

4. Our lecture this week stated that UDP is "unreliable". If that is the case, why would we ever use it?

UDP is used despite its unreliability because it offers low latency, low overhead, and simplicity, making it ideal for real time applications, broadcast communication, IoT, and custom protocols. Its advantages often outweigh the drawbacks in scenarios where speed and efficiency are more critical than perfect data delivery.

5. What interface/abstraction is provided by the operating system to enable applications to use network communications?

The operating system provides the socket interface as the primary abstraction for network communication. Sockets enable applications to send and receive data over a network using simple function calls abstracting the complexities of network protocols and hardware. This interface supports various transport protocols and provides a consistent cross platform way to build networked applications.
